# POSTAL PARCEL TRACKING SYSTEM TO IMPROVE THE CONTROL AND DISPATCH OF SHIPMENTS NATIONWIDE AT THE BOLIVIAN POSTAL AGENCY "TRACKINGBO"

Web systems are essential for any public or private institution, as they allow processing, automating and storing information accessible at all times. This project addresses parcel tracking at the national level, starting at the headquarters of the Agencia Boliviana de Correos (AGBC) and passing through several control points where parcels are verified, monitored and delivered.

The parcel trade, including postal mail, faces problems such as lack of information on the arrival of parcels, which delays deliveries or results in parcels not being picked up. The CBGA suffers from inefficiencies in the control of inbound and outbound parcels due to outdated processes, which can lead to delays and, in the worst case, corruption.

To solve these problems, a modern and efficient system for tracking parcels nationwide was developed. This system will improve the accessibility of the service and make it more empathetic to any type of customer, ensuring a more efficient and transparent management of parcels.
